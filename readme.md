# Deep Learning A-Z course progression and learning repository

The repository contains the progression of the "Deep Learning A-Z" course by SuperDataScience progress. The commits are done by the Parts or Sections.

Each Part is devoted to learning a general branch of the object while Section are more detailed code implementations of specific instruments, algorithms etc.

## Part 0, Section 1: Welcome to the course!

In this section the codebase and datasets are shared by the team, which are downloaded and stored locally (excluded from commiting), and the repository is set.

Next will be learned such branches of Deep Learning, as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Self-Organazing Maps (SOM), Boltzmann Machines, AutoEncoders.
